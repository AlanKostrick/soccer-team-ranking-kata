In Major League Soccer, the top 6 ranked teams in each conference make the play-offs.

Ranking:
In order to earn ranking a team must score "points". A team gets 3 points for every win and
one point for every tie. Losses give no points.

Tie-breakers:
Sometimes teams can tie in points at the end of the season. If this happens, there are tie-breakers,
These tie-breakers happen in the following order:
- More Wins
- Goal Differential (Stretch task)
- Goals For (Stretch task)
- Fewer Disciplinary Points (Stretch task)
- Away Goal Differential (Stretch task)
- Away Goals (Stretch task)

Your job is to create an application that sorts teams in order based on points.
The following tests have been created:

1. Create a Soccer Team
2. Create a Soccer Team with Data
3. 3 Points should be given to a team with 1 win
4. 4 Points should be given to a team with 1 win and 1 tie
5. Columbus Crew should be awarded 54 points for a 16 win 6 tie season
6. 2 Teams with equal wins and ties should have the same amount of points
7. A team with 2 wins and no ties should be ranked higher than a team with 1 win and 3 ties even though point totals are equal
8. League should be sorted in proper order based on points 
9. League should be sorted in proper order based on points with wins tiebreaker
